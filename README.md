# Mapping_Earthquakes with JS & APIs
## Overview: 
### Github
Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch. Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
### JavaScript
1.	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
2.	Create Mapbox API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
3.	Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
4.	Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
5.	Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
6.	Render maps on a local server.
### GeoJson
*	Points that contain addresses and locations e.g. latitudes and longitudes coordinates
* Linestings which contains boundaries of streets and highways travel routes and tectonic plates 
* Polygons which contain coordinates for the boundaries of zipcodes, counties, provinces and tracts of lands 

We will use Leaflet and Mapbox API to retrieve GeoJson earthquake and tectonic data
## Results:
### Creating the overlays and controls:
